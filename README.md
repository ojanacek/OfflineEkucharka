# Offline e-kucharka
Offline recipe browser created during Czechitas Hackaton 8/2015 with my team consisting of me and 3 girls. It took 5 hours from coming up with an idea to finishing this proof of concept. Testing data are available at http://1drv.ms/1NiBm6M and to oepn them in the app, simply place the whole "Recepty" directory alongside the app exe file.
